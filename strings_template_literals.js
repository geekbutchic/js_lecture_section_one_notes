//The reason you would get undefined in the console log is due to variable scoping within your code. You've declared the variable century multiple times using the let keyword, but in different scopes, which creates separate instances of the variable.

//Inside the if block, you again declare a variable century using let and assign it the value 20. This variable is local to the if block's scope and has no connection to the century variable declared in the global scope.

//Inside the else block, you again declare a variable century using let and assign it the value 21. Similar to the previous case, this variable is local to the else block's scope and is separate from the other century variables.

//After the if-else block, you try to log the value of century to the console. However, at this point, the century variable in the global scope still has not been assigned any value, so its default value is undefined, and that's what gets logged to the console.

//The .toLocaleString() method in JavaScript is used to convert a number into a string representation with locale-specific formatting. This means that the number is converted into a string while taking into account the user's locale, which includes factors like the preferred decimal separator, thousands separator, and grouping of digits based on the locale's conventions.

//The .toLocaleString() method is influenced by the user's locale settings, which can vary based on their country and language preferences. You can also explicitly specify a locale using the optional parameter of the method.

//.toLocalString() example
const number = 1000000;

// Using the user's default locale
const formattedDefault = number.toLocaleString();
