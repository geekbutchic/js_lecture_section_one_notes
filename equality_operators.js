//Need to convert to a number due to coercion to string

  console.log(`Number is not 23, 9, or 7 ðŸ˜£ oops!!!`);

//Lecture:  Equality Operators : == vs ===

/*
1. Declare a variable 'numNeighbors'
 based on a prompt input like this: prompt (`How many neighbor countries does your country have?')
 
 2. If there is only 1 neighbor country, log to the console.(`Only 1 border!`) use loose equality == for now.

 3. Use an else-if block to log `1 More than 1 border` in case 'numNeighbors' is greater than 1`.
 
 4. Use an else block to log `No Borders` (this block will be executed when 'numNeighbors' is 0 or any other value).

 5. Test the code with different values of 'numNeighbor', including 1 and 0.

 6. Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of 'numNeighbors'. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why is this happening?

 7. Finally, convert 'numNeighbors' to a number, and watch what happens now when you input 1.

 8. Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this situation.
